# COMP.5210-Assignment-1 Plan

### Project brief:
My client Owens Infastrucure spealialise in commercial construction such as multi-level carparks etc. They have requested a new website that can present their operations in a unique and industry-forward way that keeps up with modern-web design trends. A virtual space for them to showcase their work and interact with potential clients is vital. My client is also looking to expand their company and want to introduce their expansion through the website with visually appealing and informative demonstrations that welcome future projects.
### Specification list:

+ Clean and modern theme that fits within the scope of the industry
+ Large bold headings with attractive text
+ Some images but not too many that the site looks cluttered
+ Visually engaging demonstrations/Videos/Diagrams
+ An efficient and practical way to communicate with potential clients
+ Mobile responsive
+ Hosted on a fast server

### Wireframes:

The following wireframes are based on my client specifications and research. The designs do not mimic that of smilar websites and are a fresh approach to the industry. The client wanted uncluttered pages with lots of space, minimal but captivating images and bold headings. Out of the 3 wireframes my client as taken interest to number 3 (on the right) as it is most fitting with the design trend direction they want to take. This has given me a good indication of how to preoceed and I will work whith this layout with the continued development.
