The following research provides information regrading companies of a similar nature, customer requirements of such a site and current web design trends. This information will assist me in building a website for Owens Infastructure.

### Examples of similar Websites:

+ [Fletcher Construction](http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz)
+ [Higgins Consruction](https://www.higgins.co.nz/)
+ [Hawkins Construction](https://hawkins.co.nz/)

### Key items to include in such a site:

+ About the company page/Company story/
+ Who the employees are/Meet the team
+ What the company actually does/specializes in
+ Past projects/Awards
+ Contact form
+ Careeer opportunities page
+ Current news in relation to the industry
+ Social media links

### Client special requirements:

The client wants the website to look and feel vastly diffrent from similar websites that have been designed in a similar way.

### Current web design trends:

The 3 websites above that were analyzed all look very similar in design. They incorporate large high quality imagary with animated headings and interactive buttons. The use of scolling parralax seems to be the trend at the moment.
